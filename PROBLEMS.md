## Current Issue: Flashing Fails with Blank Popup

**Problem:** Device-specific firmware selection was implemented, but flashing doesn't work. When attempting to flash, a blank text popup appears instead of the expected flashing interface.

**Expected Behavior:** Should work like the original Meshtastic web flasher, just with different firmware URLs and image sources.

**Key Differences to Investigate:**
- Different firmware URL structure
- Different image source paths
- Potential missing dependencies or configuration

**Comparison Needed:**
- `/home/linux/code/meshtastic-web-flasher` (original working flasher)
- `/home/linux/code/tastic-flasher` (our fork with issues)

**Implementation Status:**
✅ Device-specific firmware URL generation
✅ GitHub Pages deployment
❌ Actual flashing functionality

**Root Cause Identified:**
The `fetchBinaryContent` method was using `getCorsFriendyReleaseUrl()` which points to the original Meshtastic GitHub Pages location:
- `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meshtastic/meshtastic.github.io/master/`

But our tastic firmware files are hosted at:
- `https://roperscrossroads.github.io/tasticfw/firmware/{version}/`

**Fix Applied:**
✅ Updated `fetchBinaryContent` to use the correct GitHub Pages URL structure
✅ Replaced `getCorsFriendyReleaseUrl()` with direct GitHub Pages URL construction

**Next Steps:**
1. Build and deploy the fix
2. Test firmware file accessibility
3. Verify the flashing interface works correctly
4. Test all three supported devices

**Technical Context:**
The device selection and firmware URL generation logic was successfully implemented, but the firmware file fetching was pointing to the wrong location, causing the flashing process to fail when trying to download firmware binaries.
