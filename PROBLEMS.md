## Current Issue: Flashing Fails with Blank Popup

**Problem:** Device-specific firmware selection was implemented, but flashing doesn't work. When attempting to flash, a blank text popup appears instead of the expected flashing interface.

**Expected Behavior:** Should work like the original Meshtastic web flasher, just with different firmware URLs and image sources.

**Key Differences to Investigate:**
- Different firmware URL structure
- Different image source paths
- Potential missing dependencies or configuration

**Comparison Needed:**
- `/home/linux/code/meshtastic-web-flasher` (original working flasher)
- `/home/linux/code/tastic-flasher` (our fork with issues)

**Implementation Status:**
✅ Device-specific firmware URL generation
✅ GitHub Pages deployment
❌ Actual flashing functionality

**Root Cause Identified:**
The `fetchBinaryContent` method was trying to fetch individual firmware files from GitHub Pages, but our tastic firmware is distributed as ZIP files through GitHub Releases:
- Release URLs: `https://github.com/roperscrossroads/tasticfw/releases/download/tastic-v0.0.5/firmware-{device}-tastic-v0.0.5.zip`

**Fix Applied:**
✅ Enhanced `fetchBinaryContent` to detect GitHub Release URLs (containing `/releases/download/`)
✅ When detected, downloads the ZIP and extracts the requested firmware file
✅ Preserves original behavior for GitHub Pages hosted files (fallback)
✅ Maintains full compatibility with manual file uploads

**Next Steps:**
1. Build and deploy the fix
2. Test firmware file accessibility
3. Verify the flashing interface works correctly
4. Test all three supported devices

**Technical Context:**
The device selection and firmware URL generation logic was successfully implemented, but the firmware file fetching was pointing to the wrong location, causing the flashing process to fail when trying to download firmware binaries.
